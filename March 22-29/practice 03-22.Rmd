```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## `separate` function

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

url <- "https://data.iowa.gov/api/views/3adi-mht4/rows.csv"
campaign <- readr::read_csv(url)
```

1. Use `separate` to split the date variable into year, month and day.

```{r}
campaign1 = campaign %>% separate(Date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(day = as.numeric(day))

campaign2 = campaign1 %>% separate(`Address - Line 1`, into = c("adress number", "street"))

sum(campaign1$`Expenditure Amount`)
max(campaign1$`Expenditure Amount`)

campaign1 %>% filter(`Expenditure Amount` == max(`Expenditure Amount`))

campaign1 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum = sum(`Expenditure Amount`)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + geom_bar(aes(weight = sum))
```
