```{R}
library(classdata)
cities[1:10,]

mean(cities$Burglary, na.rm=T)
sd(cities$Burglary, na.rm = T)
```

I could answer questions that try to see which cities have the highest violent crime rates, and overall crime rates by using a formula that computes these statistics. I could also answer questions about if a larger population can contribute to higher crime. Or if incidences of one type of crime can lead to more of another type of crime.
